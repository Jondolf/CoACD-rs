//! Concavity cost functions.
//!
//! The concavity metric of a solid shape is `concavity = max(h_b, h_i)` (Eq. 4)
//!
//! The terms `h_b` and `h_i` are the Hausdorff distances between sampled point sets of the shape
//! and its convex hull:
//!
//! ```text
//! h_b = hausdorff_distance(sample_boundary(shape), sample_boumdary(convex_hull)) (Eq. 2)
//! h_i = hausdorff_distance(sample_interior(shape), sample_interior(convex_hull)) (Eq. 3)
//! ```
//!
//! Computing an accurate estimate for `h_b` is feasible, but computing `h_i` accurately
//! would require too many samples to be practical. Instead, we use a surrogate term `r_v`:
//!
//! ```text
//! r_v = cbrt(3 * abs(volume(shape) - volume(convex_hull)) / (4 * PI)) (Eq. 5)
//! ```
//!
//! The geometric interpretation of `r_v` is the radius of a sphere with the same volume
//! as the absolute difference in volume between the shape and its convex hull,
//! which is potentially the largest inscribed sphere that could fit inside the concavity.
//!
//! We can prove a theoretical guarantee for `r_v`:
//!
//! ```text
//! sqrt(2) * max(h_b, r_v) >= max(h_b, h_i) (Theorem 1)
//! ```
//!
//! The theorem means that we can use `h_b` and `r_v` to bound the true concavity `max(h_b, h_i)`
//! and be able to recognize any unreasonable approximations. In practice, `r_v` tends to overestimate `h_i`.
//! Thus, we scale it by a coefficient `k` in the range `[0.0, 1.0)`:
//!
//! ```text
//! concavity â‰ˆ max(h_b, k * r_v) (Eq. 6)
//! ```
//!
//! The above equation is our final concavity metric.
