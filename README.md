# CoACD

A Rust implementation of [Approximate Convex Decomposition for 3D Meshes with Collision-Aware Concavity and Tree Search][1] by Xinyue Wei, Minghua Liu, Zhan Ling, and Hao Su.

The goal is to have the full CoACD algorithm reimplemented in pure Rust, with equivalent or improved performance and quality.

## Warning

This is a work in progress, and *not* functional yet! Core parts of the algorithm are still missing.
Check back later when things are more fleshed out, unless you want to just take a peek at the code :)
